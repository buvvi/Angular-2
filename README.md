# Angular-2-
Drag and Drop 


HI Friends ,


I have tested the Drag and Drop sinple example .

There is no need to change this code to run the same in your machine .


Basic Stuff like Node js installation must be in your machine .

Type the below comment in Cmd 


npm install 

npm start .


Thats it you will get the nice drag and drop example in Angular 2
